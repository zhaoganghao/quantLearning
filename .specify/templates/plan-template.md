# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95 response time, optimized database queries, or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

1. **Code Quality Standards** (I): Implementation MUST adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines with type hints for all function signatures. Code reviews MUST validate compliance before merging.

2. **Comprehensive Testing Requirements** (II): Feature MUST include unit tests with minimum 90% coverage and integration tests for all critical user flows. TDD is required for all new functionality.

3. **User Experience Consistency** (III): All user interfaces MUST follow consistent design patterns. Error messages MUST be user-friendly and actionable. API responses MUST maintain consistent structure.

4. **Performance Optimization** (IV): Feature MUST meet defined performance benchmarks: API response times under 200ms for 95% of requests. Performance tests MUST be included for any feature that could impact system responsiveness.

5. **Security by Design** (V): Implementation MUST follow security best practices including input validation, output encoding, and protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
